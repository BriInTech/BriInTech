# Welcome

My name is :sparkles: Brianna Ford :sparkles: and I am a business analyst :bar_chart: :briefcase:. My primary focus is to analyze the operations and performance of a company in order to identify areas for improvement and recommend solutions. My ultimate goal is to help organizations make informed decisions that drive success.

> A business analyst is like a detective, but with numbers instead of clues. :female_detective: :mag_right:
